//Instance variables are always declared as "private" - because we want to encapsulate this from being accessed from another class

//Instance methods are always declared "public" because we want it to be accessible

//We can have many parameterized constructors which have the same name but different number of parameters
//We can only have 1 default constructor within a class
// If we do not have any constructors in the class - java automatically created a default constructor by setting default values (integers in to 0, String into null)
